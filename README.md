# Answering Business Questions
In this project, I have been working with Northwind Database, a sample database shipped along with Microsoft Access (data is about 'Northwind Traders', a fictional company and its regarding sales transactions)

The project consists of three parts:

- Answered business questions on the data in SQL such as:
  - Which products do cost less than $20?
  - Which products do cost between $15 and $25?
  - Which products do cost more than average price? 
  - Which customer do have the highest order amount?
  - Which products  do have less units in stock than the quantity on order?
  - Which products are most expensive? Which ones are least expensive?
  - What is the hiring age of each employee?

- Loaded the data into a PostgreSQL DB using AWS RDS and installed Metabase using AWS EC2
- Built an interactive dashboard on a cloud server using Metabase.
