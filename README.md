# Metabase Dashboard based on a PostgreSQL database using AWS (RDS/EC2)
In this project, I have been working with Northwind Database, a sample database shipped along with Microsoft Access (data is about 'Northwind Traders', a fictional company and its regarding sales transactions)

The project consists of three parts:

- Answered business questions on the data using PostgreSQL queries.
- Loaded the data into a PostgreSQL DB using AWS RDS and installed Metabase using AWS EC2.
- Built an interactive dashboard on a cloud server using Metabase.
