# Answering Business Questions
In this project, I have been working with Northwind Database, a sample database shipped along with Microsoft Access (data is about 'Northwind Traders', a fictional company and its regarding sales transactions)
and performed analysis on their data to answer business questions such as:
- Which products do cost less than $20?
- Which products do cost between $15 and $25?
- Which products do cost more than average price? 
- Which customer do have the highest order amount?
- Which products  do have less units in stock than the quantity on order?
- Which products are most expensive? Which ones are least expensive?
- What is the hiring age of each employee?
