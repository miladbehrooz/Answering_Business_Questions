# Metabase Dashboard based on a PostgreSQL database using AWS (RDS/EC2)
In this project, I have been working with **Northwind Database**, a sample database shipped along with Microsoft Access (data is about 'Northwind Traders', a fictional company and regarding sales transactions)

The project consists of three parts:

- Answered **business questions** on the data using **PostgreSQL queries**.
- Loaded the data into a **PostgreSQL DB** using **AWS RDS** and installed **Metabase** using **AWS EC2**.
- Built an **interactive dashboard** on a **cloud server** using **Metabase**.

*Note:
Since AWS is a paid service, I deleted the RDS instance; hence, the dashboard is offline. I am thinking to bring it back online using docker and the (still active) EC2 instance*
